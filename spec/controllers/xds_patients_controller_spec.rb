# commented out 2010-07-15 ccabot because it looks as if this code
# depends on config/initializers/laika_validation.rb which lives in
# laika but not in this project.  FIXME we shoule either remove this
# file entirely or move the necessary stuff from laika to popHealth to
# make this work.

# describe XdsPatientsController do
#   before { controller.stub!(:current_user).and_return mock_model(User) }

#   it "reads existing entries from the XDS server"
#   it "adds a document to the XDS server"
